                Hey Darling . . .
            </div>
            <p class="pVt1">
                Last year was a wild ride, lots of things happened, some good, some bad and some are just 'right', and you're one of the best things 
                that happened to my life last year. Maybe i failed to to go to my dream college, maybe im failed to get Nahida, but im managed to obtain 
                my dream girl, the girl that i liked since i was 13 yo, and the person that im comfortable having around with. To be honest i dont even know 
                how did i even got myself someone as beatiful as you as how dense and random i am.
            </p>
            <p class="pVt2">
                Now this may not looks like the best website ever, but im still learning so bear with it (ɔ◔‿◔)ɔ, i made this cuz well i want to learn some new skill 
                but i also want to give you some present during valentine, at first i was planning to buy some sort of doll or something, but i thought that giving 
                doll sounds lazy and all i do is just took out some cash, so i did the 180 degree and made something that cost me almost nothing in currency wkwk.
            </p>
            <p class="pVt3">
                Actually i want to meet you during the valentine, but looking at the cicumstances i quickly realise that its almost imposssible to do, ofcourse it 
                would've been more fun for us to meet up on valentinte but i hope you can understand darling. Im doing my best in college so i hope if fate allow 
                us to be together one day, we will life a good and comfrotable live and when you read this youre probably also in college right now, and i hope everything the 
                best for you (ɔ◔‿◔)ɔ.
            </p>
            <p class="pVt4">
                And lastly, eventhought our music taste maybe different, but i thinks thats what makes it good, so we can explore and learn abut each other 
                taste in mucic, so here i take some of our music and some of it lyrics, and i realised, maybe our music taste is not that different. <br> <br>
                Anywayy Happy Valentine!
